# Customer Segmentation Anlaysis 

Objective :
 
 In this report, I aim to segment customers based on their behavior using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. By finding out how recently customers have made purchases, often they make purchases, and how much they spend, I will  identify customer segments and make informed decisions to improve engagement, retention, and marketing strategies


Tools Used : Python 

Dataset:[Here]()

# Understanding the dataset:
Dataset includes columns > Customer Id,Total Spent, Items purshased, Days since last purchase,Membership Id ect. These fields will help to understand the behaviorof each customer.
  
  #Dataset structure
  

# What is RFM: Recency,Frequency, and Monetary 
Recency- how recent a customer purchased

Frequency- How often a customer makes a purchase

Monetary- $ amount a customer spends

# Process 

- First I went and made RFM scores for each customer. And how the scoring goes is 1-5 and the higher the score the more engaged and valuable the customer is. 

 - Second after I calcualted the indivisual scores, I summed them up to get a full RFM score, then after finding out the ultimate scores I started to segment them.
